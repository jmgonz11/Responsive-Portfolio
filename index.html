            <p> My name is Jade Gonzales. I just moved to Dallas from the island of Oahu, Hawaii. I am a Experienced Salesforce Adoption Manager with a 
                demonstrated history of working in Customer Relationship Management Automation in the Sales & Digital Marketing and Advertising industry. 
                I'm passionate about helping my colleagues learn how to use and be proficient in Salesforce to better streamline sales processes and create engaging customer relationships. 
                Solving problems excites me, and putting out Salesforce fires is my game. 
                When I'm not talking about Salesforce, I like to tell really bad dad Jokes or go Scuba Diving.
            </p>

            <p> Some interesting facts about me: I used to work for Disney in College. I originally wanted to work in the entertainment industry which landed me two internships with Disney in Orlando, Florida and Anaheim, California. 
                When I was younger, I was competed in pageants and was a competitive dancer in high school.
